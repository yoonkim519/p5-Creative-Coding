# P5 Instance Mode and Intro to HTML
Also welcome to GitHub, a website where code for tons of open source projects is shared and hosted.

We'll be using it as a way to host our own websites through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

A page like this is called a **repository** or **repo**, basically a folder in which code is stored. Just download this repo as a zip file and open up the files in [Brackets](https://brackets.io) to follow along.
